# The_oldest_businesses

In the present work, an analysis of different databases is conducted based on the question "Which and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses?". The analysis yielded multiple answers that encompass the world's oldest company and its location, such as Kong≈ç Gumi in Japan, founded as early as the year 578. Another answer can be approached from each country's perspective, as exemplified by Mexico and its Casa de Moneda dating back to 1534. The continents also provide information that can address the questions when analyzing the data, as they offer specific results for each of them.
The deficiencies and problems that could arise in any dataset are not an exception in this analysis and are addressed through data supplementation. The analysis covers the categories presented in the dataset and the sum of their founding years. These results should be analyzed based on the intended purpose, as demonstrated by an example of a specific search within the restaurant category. The search filters the oldest restaurants founded before 1800, yielding three results from an extensive database.
"Which?" and "Where?" choices to answer these questions can be made in various ways and always depend on the desired objective. Therefore, it is important to narrow down the search and have clear objectives, applying an objective and precise analysis.
